# TicTacToe
This is a Kotlin app of my own design.  It is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.  It has nine buttons (one for each move choice on the board), plus a "Start New Game" button. Upon the first press (and all "odd" presses) of a button, an "X" is placed on it.  An "O" is placed on all "even" turns.  Upon being pressed, the button is disabled, to disallow repeat pressing.  After every turn, a "Win" is checked for, which would be if three buttons in a row have either an "X" or an "O".  If 9 turns are taken and all buttons filled, but there is no winner, it will say "Tie!".  If there is a winner, it will say "X wins!" or "O wins!", and all further button presses will be disabled, except for the "Start New Game" button, which will reset the board, making all buttons blank "" and clickable, removing the winning text, and making the move count go back to zero, awaiting the first move again.
